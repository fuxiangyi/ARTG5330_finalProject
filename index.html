        <p>This is a small multiples map to show the Air Quality Index(AQI)
            in USA through 1980 to 2013. I choose visualization tool
            small multiples because they are a good way to show changes on
            data going through the time which based on same spatial information.
            The AQI data sources is coming from<a href ="http://www.epa.gov/airdata/ad_rep_aqi.html"> US Environmental Protection Agency </a>.
            The data reports display annual summary of AQI values for core based
            statistical areas(CBSA). I choose the AQI median value to visualize,
            which means half of daily AQI values during the year were less that or
            equal to the median value, and half equaled or exceeded it. Therefore
            in the showing map the darker point means higher AQI median value,
            which means worse air quality. </p>
